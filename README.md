This project is a restaurant client–waiter communication system.
The idea came from my work experience in restaurants, where sometimes a customer tries to call a waiter but the waiter is busy, doesn’t hear, or doesn’t see resulting in a small service gap.

With this app, customers can send requests directly from their table, and the waiter (or admin) sees them instantly on a tablet/dashboard. This way, the service loop stays smooth and efficient.

Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js (Express)

Database: SQLite (with bcrypt for password hashing)

Auth: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Other: Axios for HTTP requests
